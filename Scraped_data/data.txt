The final year project evaluation metrics in NUML is based on the aggregated total of all evaluations of the Final year project, as shown in Table 1. The evaluation consists of three parts: Final year project proposal report and presentation (40% of the evaluation), FYP Progress Report and Presentation (40% of the evaluation), and Final Project Defense (20% of the evaluation). The marks carried forward from Progress and Final Presentation are 70% of the total marks, and the marks assigned by the supervisor are 30% of the total marks. Thanks for asking!
